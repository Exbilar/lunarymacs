* UPDATE!

After sharing my config/framework for some time,
I realized that trying to make the config fit everybody is naive and unessessary.

It seems to me that most people likes to fork and modify default starts to their taste,
instead of adding config in private stars.
That makess merging upstream a bit more messy.

"Working tree clean" is super important, as well as keeping update to date in core.
So I decide to seperate luanrymacs core and my personal (default) configs.
Then you can be in sync with core easily and manage your config in another repo:
maybe a fork of default configs, but you don't need to ever merge upstream of that.

I'll also add make commands for convenience.

It is adviced to show news on startup, so you can follow the really important changes in core.

* UPDATE!

I changed the core, now you *don't* need to declare package dependencies in =package|= anymore,
=use-package|= will do that for you!

Also, quelpa support is added, 
just replace package symbol with a quelpa recipe,
all the macros and functions would just work.

This is a stripped down framework modeling after doom-emacs. It's extremely basic, but working for me.

*Warning:* There is no seatbelt.

- *code is easy* to understand (since I don't really know too much elisp)
- *not opinionated*: no default settings set in core. 
  everything is up to you. So you can follow the latest update in core
  while keeping your own config safe.
- *minimum* core files
- *no default package* required by core except use-package and quelpa
  

*In summary:* 

This project is a good starting point of your own config!
You can:
1. Use my configuration(opinionated) and add your own config (submit PR to casour/luanrymacs-stars if you think yours is good!)
2. *OR* Only use the core as a framework and manage your own configurations within it.
3. *OR* Just read the core and wiki as a reference and build your own config from scratch.

* Quick start

*backup you .emacs.d first!*

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone https://github.com/casouri/lunarymacs.git ~/.emacs.d
cd ~/.emacs.d
cp init.example.el init.el
git clone https://github.com/casouri/lunarymacs-stars.git star
make
emacs

# to update lunarymacs
git pull --rebase

# or
make update-moon # it's the same
#+END_SRC

* Thank you
Thanks to all the contributors of spacemacs and doom-emacs. I copyied a lot of code from them.

Thanks to everyone in emacs-china.org, you answered many questions of mine.

And of course a big thank-you to all the package contributors and emacs contributors. I can't enjoy such a great editor without your effort.

Emacs community is the best! :smile: :heart: (just rhetorical, not comparing :P)
* etc
  
I don't know what is lunary.

I know it says lunarymacs but homepage is moon emacs, it's for visual effect.

Stay fresh!
