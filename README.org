This is a stripped down framework modeling after doom-emacs. It's extremely basic, but working for me.

*Warning:* There is no seatbelt.

- *code is easy* to understand (since I don't really know too much elisp)
- *not opinionated*: no default settings set in core. 
  everything is up to you. So you can follow the latest update in core
  while keeping your own config safe.
- *minimum* core files
- *no default package* required by core except use-package and quelpa
  

*In summary:* 

This project is a good starting point of your own config!
You can:
1. Use my configuration(opinionated) and add your own config (submit PR to [[https://github.com/casouri/lunarymacs-stars][casouri/lunarymacs-stars]] if you think yours is good!)
2. *OR* Only use the core as a framework and manage your own configurations within it.
3. *OR* Just read the core and wiki as a reference and build your own config from scratch.

* Quick start
  
Lunarymacs is separated into =core= and =config=. 
=core= is this repo, and =config= is my personal configurations (stars/modules) in a separate repo.

You can clone only this repo and write your own stars, or clone both and modify my config.

*backup you .emacs.d first!*

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
# clonw core
git clone https://github.com/casouri/lunarymacs.git ~/.emacs.d
cd ~/.emacs.d
# clone my config
git clone https://github.com/casouri/lunarymacs-stars.git star
# my init.el is under star/ while init.example.el is under .emacs.d/
# don't cp my init.el unless you use Emacs 26+ on macOS 10.13+
cp init.example.el init.el
make
emacs

# to update lunarymacs
git pull --rebase

# or
make update-moon # it's the same
#+END_SRC


* Why separate repo

After sharing my config/framework for some time,
I realized that trying to make the config fit everybody is naive and unessessary.

It seems to me that most people (1/1, so actually 100%) like to fork and modify default stars to their taste,
instead of adding config in private stars.
That makess merging upstream a bit more messy.

"Working tree clean" is super important, as well as keeping update to date in core.
So I decide to seperate luanrymacs core and my personal (default) configs.
Then you can be in sync with core easily and manage your config in another repo
(maybe a fork of default configs, but you don't ever need to merge upstream of that).

* Thank you
Thanks to all the contributors of spacemacs and doom-emacs. I copyied a lot of code from them.

Thanks to everyone in emacs-china.org, you answered many questions of mine.

And of course a big thank-you to all the package contributors and emacs contributors. I can't enjoy such a great editor without your effort.

Emacs community is the best! :smile: :heart: (just rhetorical, not comparing :P)
* etc
  
I don't know what is lunary.

+I know it says lunarymacs but homepage is moon emacs, it's for visual effect.+ (Now it's changd to actual moon!)

Stay fresh!
